#Introduction: 

For this project I wanted to explore and develop my skills in programming for 2d games, I wanted to focus on AI for 2d games and to generally increase my C# abilities. During this project I have also made several diversions into other subjects, this includes but is not limited to: 

    Multiplayer, 
    Creating ports for mobile, 
    Particle effects and shading, 
    How best to design a card-based game, 
    Visual effects (“fluff”) and user-friendly design. 

For this project I made a simple card game battler, with inspiration taken from games such as Hearthstone. 

The game has 2 game modes; hot seat, where 2 human players take turns playing on the same computer, 
And singleplayer, where one human faces an AI opponent.
